## template folders

Two .zip files are provided in this repo, containing template folder structures for (reproducible) science projects. Feel free to use and change until they meet your requirements!

The backup .zip folder contains two separate .Rmd templates that knit to a Word document and a HTML document, in case my risky knitting-live-to-pdf-demo failed. You can use them to knit your documents if you like, but they were generated using the stevetemplates R package, so I would recommend using that instead.

Also, consider the rticles package: https://github.com/rstudio/rticles
