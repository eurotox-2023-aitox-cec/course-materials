```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
smaller <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about  ` r nrow( diamonds ) ` diamonds.  
Only ` r nrow( diamonds ) - nrow( smaller ) ` are larger than 2.5 carats. 
The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r frequency}
smaller %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
